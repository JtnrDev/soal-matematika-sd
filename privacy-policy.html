  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Contact Email:</strong> jtnrdev@gmail.com</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information for users of the <strong>Soal MTK SD</strong> app ("App", "Service") developed by <strong>JtnrDev</strong> ("we", "us", "our").
  </p>
  <p>
    We value and protect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information. 
    Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. <strong>By visiting or using the app or services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect and Use</h2>
  <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Email address</li>
    <li>Phone number</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Social media profiles</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    In the event of app errors or crashes, we may collect technical information through services like Google Play Console, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device model</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>Time and date of the error</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Technical error details</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is used solely for app maintenance and debugging purposes. It does not include personal identity information.</p>

  <h2>Advertisements</h2>
  <p>
    To keep the App free for all users, it displays advertisements. We use the Google AdMob SDK (Software Development Kit) as our advertising provider.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since this App is directed to children, the AdMob SDK is configured to comply with Google Play's Families Policy and applicable children's privacy regulations. This means that <strong>personalized advertising is disabled</strong> for all users of the App.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even with personalized ads disabled, the AdMob SDK may collect certain non-personal identifiers, such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID or Device ID)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Usage information</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This data is used by the AdMob SDK solely to serve contextual ads (ads based on the content of the app), limit the number of times the same ad is shown (frequency capping), and prevent fraudulent activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    We select ad providers that are safe for kids. However, while we take steps to filter inappropriate content, we do not have complete control over every single advertisement that appears, as the Ad Network ultimately determines the specific ad content from their inventory. Any data collected by the AdMob SDK is subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    This app does not use cookies. However, third-party services like Google Play Services or external services that may be integrated in the future could use cookies or similar tracking technologies in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app is designed for children between the ages of 6 and 12. We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personal data from children.<br>
    If you believe your child has provided personal information by mistake, please contact us at jtnrdev@gmail.com so we can take immediate action.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect technical and operational data collected for app performance and troubleshooting. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    As no personal information is collected or stored by this app, no action is required to access, modify, or delete user data. Users may uninstall the app at any time to stop using the service.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be effective when posted on this page. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for the latest information.
